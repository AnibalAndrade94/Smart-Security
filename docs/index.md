The use of video surveillance systems has been growing significantly in recent years. This growth is mainly due to the need to ensure the safety of people. For this reason, the number of applications that have been developed to solve this problem have increased significantly. Solutions that go from the simplest, such as monitoring systems, to more complex, like those capable of determine possible risk situations. 

With the emergence of new technologies, like cloud computing, now user can be provided with other resources, for instance, Large data storage capacities, processing power, etc. Besides, software support and system updates can be done remotely.

With the goal of addressing this problem we have created a video surveillance project based on the cloud computing schema, this project is called ViVA (Video Vigilancia Autom√°tica), for its acronym in Spanish. In this project we have proposed a software architecture (for more details see next section), furthermore, we also have develop a set of computer vision algorithms to obtain a description of what is happening in a monitored area, and then to take appropriate action based on that interpretation, in both, indoor (e.g. offices) and outdoor environments (like parking lots).

In general, our video surveillance system is capable of acquiring a video stream from a set of cameras connected to the network, process that information to detect motion, classify moving objects and track them; report a description of what is happening in a monitored area, store the information on a remote server, and help the users to take the appropriate action.
